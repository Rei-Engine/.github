# Rei Engine

Welcome to the **Rei Engine** organization. This is the official organization for the Rei Engine, alongside engine versions.

The Rei Engine is designed to be a cross-platform, 2D & 3D game engine for simplicity, while still allowing full control over your code and engine.

The current engine being worked on is: **Rei Engine I**
